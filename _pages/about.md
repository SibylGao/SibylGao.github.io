I am a Ph.D. student in Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS), advised by Prof. Zhaoqi Wang. I got my bachelorâ€™s degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2019.

My research interests lie in the field of 3D visions, especially multi-view stereo, 3D reconstruction (large-scale scenes & human body) and 3D detection.
