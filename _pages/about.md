I am a PhD student in Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS), advised by Prof. Zhaoqi Wang. I got my bachelor‚Äôs degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2019.

My research interests lie in the field of 3D visions, especially multi-view stereo, 3D reconstruction (large-scale scenes & human body) and 3D detection.

**CFDS3D: Centroid Feature Diffusion Sampling framework for 3D Object Detection** \\
Haotian Hu, Fanyi Wang, Jingwen Su, **Shiyu Gao**, Yaonong Wang, Laifeng Hu, Yuan Zhou, Yuhan Wang, Jineng Han, Mingyang Zhang, Weiye Fang

- We introduce a point-based 3D detection framework, named CFDS3D, which achieves efficient and accurate detection in large-scale point clouds scenes when inserting to existing point-based methods

[Cost Volume Pyramid Network with Multi-strategies Range Searching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.12032.pdf) \\
**Shiyu Gao**, Zhaoxin Li, Zhaoqi Wang

**Project Link üëâ:** [https://github.com/SibylGao/MSCVP-MVSNet](https://github.com/SibylGao/MSCVP-MVSNet) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='4FA6C0AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC'></span></strong>

- We discuss the impact of different search strategies in each stage for pyramid-based MVS methods and propose MS-CVPMVSNet, a pyramid-based method which leverage multi-dimensional information.
- To further exploit information in cost volume of deep MVS, we propose unimodal assumption as a training label in second stage.
- Our method obtains SOTA results (especially in completeness) on DTU and BlendedMVS dataset.
