I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS), advised by Prof. Zhaoqi Wang. I got my bachelorâ€™s degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2019.

My research interests lie in the field of computer vision and computer graphics, especially multi-view stereo, 3D reconstruction of large-scale scenes and human body from single or multiple images.
